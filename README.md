Machine Learning project predicting student performance using Linear Regression
# Student Marks Prediction

This is a simple **Machine Learning project** that predicts a student's marks based on the number of hours they study, using **Linear Regression**.

---

## Project Overview
- **Objective:** Predict student scores using study hours as input.
- **Dataset:** A small dataset containing hours studied vs. marks scored.
- **Algorithm Used:** Linear Regression (Supervised Learning)
- **Tools:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, Google Colab.

## Steps Performed
1. Imported and cleaned the dataset.
2. Visualized data using scatter plots.
3. Split data into training and testing sets.
4. Trained a Linear Regression model.
5. Evaluated performance using R² score and Mean Squared Error.

---

##  Results
The model showed a strong positive correlation between **study hours and marks**, confirming that more study time leads to higher scores.
